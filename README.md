# Matrix Chart
<a href="https://github.com/jessebot/matrix-chart/releases"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jessebot/matrix-chart?style=plastic&labelColor=blue&color=green&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white"></a>

A Helm chart for deploying a Matrix homeserver stack in Kubernetes. This is a fork of [Arkaniad/matrix-chart](https://github.com/Arkaniad/matrix-chart), which is a fork of [typokign/matrix-chart](https://github.com/typokign/matrix-chart). 

## TLDR

See [charts/matrix/README.md](./charts/matrix/README.md) for docs auto-generated from the [`values.yaml`](./charts/matrix/values.yaml).
Read through the parameters and modify them locally before installing the chart:

```bash
helm repo add matrix https://jessebot.github.io/matrix-chart
helm install my-release-name matrix --values values.yaml
```

## Current Features ‚ú®

- Latest version of [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) (the official homeserver edition of matrix)
- Ingress definitions for federated Synapse (Matrix homeserver) and Element (frontend and CMS for matrix)

### Optional Features

- Use (existing) Kubernetes Secrets for confidential data, such as passwords
- Use OIDC configs for SSO (see synapse [docs](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/747416e94cd8f137b9173c132f7c44ea1c59534d/docs/openid.md) for more info)
- Latest version of [Element](https://element.io/)
- [Bitnami PostgreSQL subchart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) to deploy a cluster - needs some work to standardize though, so we also support external postgresql servers
- [Coturn TURN server subchart](https://github.com/jessebot/coturn-chart) for VoIP calls
- Use [s3 to store stuff](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider/tree/main)
- Use an existing Kubernetes Secret for an external mail server for email notifications

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Features (Untested Since Fork)

These features still need to be tested, but are technically baked into the chart from the fork:

- Use of lightweight Exim relay
- [Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord) Discord bridge
- [matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc) IRC bridge
- [tulir/mautrix-whatsapp](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp) WhatsApp bridge

## Status

Working on full stability, but always happy to receive GitHub Issues or PRs üíô

This chart is now maintained mostly by me, @jessebot, but I'd love contributors as well! My goal is to provide regular updates using dependabot (maybe renovatebot soon) and provide some level of basic security from a k8s perspective. The aim as of right now has been removing any plaintext secrets and allowing for existing PVCs. I'm also trying to standardize the chart more by following predictable values.yaml patterns.

Note: I may stop supporting this if a larger entity maintains a better matrix chart (e.g. Bitnami releases a matrix helm chart), as then I'll just write PRs directly to them. At that time I'll put in a note in this README before publicly archiving the repo. As of right now though, in October 2023, there are no other actively maintained matrix helm charts for matrix that meet all my needs or are regularly updated to justify creating PRs.
